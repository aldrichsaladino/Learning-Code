# Sports Landing Page Solutions
This is a simple landing page that introduces various different sports. This project is to demonstrate the application of CSS skills from The Odin Projects Foundations path. The foundations path of CSS focuses on uses flexboxes and it's properties to style the layout

Rather than a base layout the plan is to use sports, something I like as a base for other examples and pictures
