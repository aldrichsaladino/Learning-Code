# F1 Data Overview
This repository is intended to be a working session repository for digging into F1 Data. As someone who has actively watched Formula 1 for quite some time, I've naturally become more and more interested in the data analysis of racing, and how teams use this to their advantage in understanding the cars and performance on the grid

All files and data will be a working project of my interests! :)
